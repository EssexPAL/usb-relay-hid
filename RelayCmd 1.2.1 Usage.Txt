Use of the command line application RelayCmd.exe

Usage:
    
    RelayCmd [ID=x] ON=n or OFF=n

    ID=x Where x is the board occurance i.e. The order in which the board/s are found
    If ID is not specified then the default will be 1
    If no boards are present then an error will be issued
    
    On=n where n = the relay number (1-8).  Multiple relays may be operated by comma separating their numbers. 
    Off=n where n = the relay number (1-8).  Multiple relays may be released by comma separating their numbers. 
    Valid relay numbers are 1 - 8 dependant upon the model of the board.
